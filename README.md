# Objective

The Coffee Garden is a small restaurant that lacks an online presence and would like to increase the engagement with its customers and potential customers through an online platform. As such they have identified the following areas of opportunity:

   * Create an online presence
   * Interact with current/potential customers
   * Create an online reservation system
   * Display key information
   * Create marketing opportunities through the social media links displayed in the site

# User Experience (UX)

-   ### Site Aims  
  The overall goal of this project is to create a restaurant webpage that is visually nice and easy to navigate to the user. Visitors should be able to find general information about the restaurant in the home page, as well as finding the menu offerings. In addition, visitors should be able to make a reservation for a table directly on the webpage. It will also provide a booking management admin panel for the restaurant owner.

## Agile Methodology

The principles of agile methodology were utilized during the project. By assigning user stories to issues and taking advantage of the GitHub Kanban board functionality, the necessary goals and priorities throughout the project could be well defined. In addition, labels were used to further define the priority of each user story in the Kanban board.

## Design

The theme for the project was chosen as per the intended target market in mind for the restaurant. It primarily focuses on attracting families, young people, residents from the area, and visitors to this region.
    
- Colors  
The main colors are overall cream-pastel, it blends well with the main product that this restaurant has to offer; the best coffe in town.
- Font  
The fonts in the theme are clear and modern and contribute perfectly to the overall look of the site.  
- Images  
The images in the theme provide great content to the site; as the user navigates through the pages; it reasures him the type of products that are being served.

## Deployment

Git and GitHub are used for version control. Python is the backend language, and can't be displayed with GitHub alone, To live preview my project, I used Heroku.

## Deployment to Heroku

### 1. Creating the Django Project
* If development if being done locally: Activate your virtual environment
* To ensure the virtual environment is not tracked by version control, add .venv to the .gitignore file.
* Install Django and gunicorn: `pip install django gunicorn`
* Install supporting database libraries dj_database_url and psycopg2 library: `pip install dj_database_url psycopg2`
* Install Cloudinary libraries to manage static files: `pip install dj-3-cloudinary-storage`
* Create file for requirements: `pip freeze --local > requirements.txt`
* Create project:`django-admin startproject project_name .`
* Create app: `python manage.py startapp app_name`
* Add app to list of `installed apps` in settings.py file: `'app_name'`
* Migrate changes: `python manage.py migrate`
* Test server works locally: `python manage.py runserver`

### 2. Create your Heroku app
* Navigate to the Heroku website
* Create a Heroku account by entering your email address and a password (or login if you have one already).
* Activate the account through the authentication email sent to your email account
* Click the **new button** on the top right corner of the screen and select create a new app from the dropdown menu.
* Enter a unique name for the application.
* Select the appropriate region for the application.
* Click create app
* In the Heroku dashboard click on the Resources tab
* Scroll down to Add-Ons, search for and select 'Heroku Postgres' / Now replaced by 'ElephantSQL'
* In the Settings tab, scroll down to 'Reveal Config Vars' and copy the text in the box beside DATABASE_URL.

### 3. Set up Environment Variables
* In you IDE create a new env.py file in the top level directory
* Add env.py to the .gitignore file
* In env.py import the os library
* In env.py add `os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]` = "Paste in the text link copied above from Heroku DATABASE_URL"
* In env.py add `os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "Make up your own random secret key"`
* In Heroku Settings tab Config Vars enter the same secret key created in env.py by entering 'SECRET_KEY' in the box for 'KEY' and your randomly created secret key in the 'value' box.

### 4. Setting up settings.py

* In your Django 'settings.py' file type:

 ```
 from pathlib import Path
 import os
 import dj_database_url

 if os.path.isfile("env.py"):
  import env
 ```
* Remove the default insecure secret key in settings.py and replace with the link to the secret key variable in Heroku by typing: `SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get(SECRET_KEY)`
* Comment out the `DATABASES` section in settings.py and replace with:
```
DATABASES = {
  'default': 
  dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
  }`
```
* Create a Cloudinary account and from the 'Dashboard' in Cloudinary copy your url into the env.py file by typing: `os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "cloudinary://<insert-your-url>"`
* In Heroku  add cloudinary url to 'config vars'
* In Heroku config vars add DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC with value of '1' (note: this must be removed for final deployment)
* Add Cloudinary libraries to the installed apps section of settings.py file:
 ```
 'cloudinary_storage'
 'django.contrib.staticfiles''
 'cloudinary'
 ```
* Connect Cloudinary to the Django app in `settings.py`:
```
STATIC_URL = '/static'
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'STATIC')]
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE =
'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
* Link file to the templates directory in Heroku 
* Place under the BASE_DIR: TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR,
'templates')
```
* Change the templates directory to TEMPLATES_DIR. Place within the TEMPLATES array: `'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR]`
* Add Heroku Hostname to ALLOWED_HOSTS: ```ALLOWED_HOSTS =
['rhi-book-nook.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']```
*Create Procfile at the top level of the file structure and insert the following:
    ``` web: gunicorn PROJECT_NAME.wsgi ```

* Make an initial (if this has not been done previously) commit and push the code to the GitHub Repository.
    ```git add .```
    ```git commit -m "Initial deployment"```
    ```git push```

### 5. Heroku Deployment: 
* Click Deploy tab in Heroku
* In the 'Deployment method' section select 'Github' and click the 'connect to Github' button to confirm.
* In the 'search' box enter the Github repository name for the project
* Click search and then click connect to link the heroku app with the Github repository. The box will confirm that heroku is connected to the repository.

### 6. Final Deployment
In the IDE: 
* When development is complete change the debug setting to: `DEBUG = False` in `settings.py` 
* In Heroku settings config vars change the DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC value to 0
* Because DEBUG must be switched to True for development and False for production it is recommended that only manual deployment is used in Heroku. 
* To manually deploy click the button 'Deploy Branch'. The default 'main' option in the dropdown menu should be selected in both cases. When the app is deployed a message 'Your app was successfully deployed' will be shown. Click 'view' to see the deployed app in the browser.
